# First GUI program
  I started learning c# and I did this task where I made a simple calculator.
  But the fact that it was using console.writeline and console.readline was annoying.
  This is my first ever attempt at making anything gui related.
  I don't know html so XAML looks uhh a bit weird ?
  Also never used github like this so if anything looks weird or it's not how ppl normally do stuff let me know.
  I used copilot to help me get the text out of the text block and make it a string since looking up anything WPF related 
just didn't yield anything helpful.
  Now I am aware it looks straight out of Windows XP, but oh well at least I tried.
